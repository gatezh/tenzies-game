# Tenzies game

Tenzie is a fast-paced dice game where your goal is to get all ten dice to show the same number. Here’s how it works in this app:

1. Roll the Dice: Start by rolling all ten dice.
2. Lock Your Dice: Click on any die showing the number you want to keep—this "locks" it so it won’t roll again.
3. Re-roll the Rest: Tap to roll the remaining unlocked dice, aiming to match your locked number.
4. Win the Round: Repeat until all ten dice display the same number.
